#remote-watering-can
a watering can on one side of the planet waters a garden on the other

In this Open Lab Experiment, a watering can containing a tilt sensor hooks up to a whimsical sprinkler system over the internet. Tilting the watering can causes a small shower to rain over the garden. Originally designed for remote couples and families, this system is meant to exemplify the tensions of stewardship in a disconnected world.
